THIS GAME IS STILL IN PROGRESS OF DEVELOPMENT

Name: Delivery City
Overall: This is a management, strategic, tycoon type of game where you can take role of the ceo of small delivery company. Help your business grow and expand.
Materials: Mostly content used for creating this game is cc0, some of the models and sounds were created or modified by me.
Algorithms: city is procedurally generated by modified version of collapsed wave function algorithm, automatic path finding mechanic is implemented via unity navmesh experimental library.

I'm trying to keep track of all the changes in project and dates in "todo list" file.
